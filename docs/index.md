Welcome to the Lexicon documentation site.

## What is Lexicon?

**Lexicon** is a simple template you can use to setup a hosted docs portal for your project, all for free using Github Pages.

I started this project as I seen more and more projects using Gitbooks which used to be a static site generator also but as of late has moved towards Docs as a Service.
Instead this project is offered to you for free at no charge, not now, not later and especially not as your team grows. Rather than prey on your success I simply want to make documentation better and more standard across the space.
